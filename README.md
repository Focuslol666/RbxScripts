## About My Work
My main asset is here: [FOCUS's Scripts](https://github.com/Focuslol666/RbxScripts/tree/main/DOORS/MyScript)
### Declare
I've uploaded some of my work to Github, and you can use it by wrapping it in "`loadstring`", "`game:HttpGet`".

```lua
-- For Example (Enter Raw URL)
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...'))()
```

but the source code is mostly obfuscated.
