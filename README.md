## About My Work
My main resource is here: [FOCUS's Scripts](https://github.com/Focuslol666/RbxScripts/tree/main/DOORS/MyScript)
## Declare
I've uploaded some of my work to Github, and you can use it by wrapping it in "```loadstring```", "`game:HttpGet`".

```lua
-- For Example
loadstring(game:HttpGet('Enter URL'))()
```

but the source code is mostly obfuscated.
