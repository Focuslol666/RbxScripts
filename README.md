## About My Work
My main resource is here: [FOCUS's Scripts](https://github.com/Focuslol666/RbxScripts/tree/main/DOORS/MyScript)
## Declare
I've uploaded some of my work to Github, and you can use it by wrapping it in

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet())()
```

but the source code is mostly obfuscated.
